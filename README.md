# R Hidden Preview

R Hidden Preview is a VS Code extension MVP that automatically runs selected R code in a hidden background process and shows immediate preview results.

When you select code in an `.R` file, the extension can:
- execute in background with `Rscript --vanilla`
- show a one-line inline summary at end-of-line
- show detailed result in a dedicated preview panel

This project is designed as a stable, maintainable first version suitable for Marketplace publishing and future iteration.

## Core Features

- Only active on R files.
- Automatic trigger on selection change (no manual Run click required).
- Hidden asynchronous execution using `child_process.spawn()`.
- Two-layer result UI:
  - Inline summary (`TextEditorDecorationType`)
  - Detailed panel (`WebviewPanel`)
- Handles failure states with explicit feedback:
  - Rscript launch failure
  - execution error
  - timeout (`预览超时`)
- Debounce to avoid excessive execution while adjusting selection.
- Cancels previous unfinished preview task when new selection arrives.
- Output truncation to keep UI responsive.
- Configurable behavior via settings.

## How It Works

1. Listen to editor selection changes.
2. Verify active editor language is R.
3. Run lightweight selection completeness checks before execution.
4. Build execution code based on context mode:
   - `selectionOnly`
   - `documentBeforeSelection` (default)
5. Create temporary files:
   - payload R code
   - runner R script wrapper
6. Spawn hidden process:
   - `Rscript --vanilla <runner.R> <payload.R> <maxOutputLength>`
7. Parse structured stdout markers into `PreviewResult`.
8. Update inline summary and panel detail.
9. Clean up temporary files and process resources.

## Execution Context Modes

### `selectionOnly`
Only executes currently selected code.

### `documentBeforeSelection` (default)
Executes code from start of document to selection start, then selected code.

Important:
- This mode may execute additional code and can cause side effects.
- Side effects depend on your selected script content.

## Safety and Side Effects

This extension executes R code in the background.

Please read carefully:
- Selected code is executed automatically when selection changes.
- In `documentBeforeSelection` mode, code before selection is also executed.
- Any executed code may have side effects (file operations, network calls, state mutation, etc.).

Recommended practices:
- Use trusted workspaces.
- Keep `requireWorkspaceTrust` enabled for safer default behavior.
- Use `selectionOnly` for stricter execution boundaries.

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.90.0 or newer
- R installed on your machine
- `Rscript` available in PATH or configured with full path in `rHiddenPreview.rscriptPath`

## Usage

1. Open an `.R` file.
2. Select code with mouse or keyboard.
3. Wait for debounce delay (default 350ms).
4. See inline summary at selected line end.
5. Open detailed panel via command:
   - `R Hidden Preview: Open Preview Panel`

## Settings

All settings are under `rHiddenPreview`:

- `rscriptPath` (string, default: `Rscript`)
  - Path to Rscript executable.
- `timeoutMs` (number, default: 3000)
  - Timeout for each preview execution.
- `debounceMs` (number, default: 350)
  - Debounce delay before triggering preview.
- `autoPreview` (boolean, default: true)
  - Enable automatic preview on selection changes.
- `contextMode` (enum, default: `documentBeforeSelection`)
  - `selectionOnly` or `documentBeforeSelection`.
- `maxOutputLength` (number, default: 2000)
  - Maximum output length before truncation.
- `showInlinePreview` (boolean, default: true)
  - Show inline end-of-line summary.
- `showPanelPreview` (boolean, default: true)
  - Show detailed panel preview.
- `requireWorkspaceTrust` (boolean, default: true)
  - Only auto-preview in trusted workspace.
- `ignoreIncompleteSelection` (boolean, default: true)
  - Skip incomplete-looking selection instead of showing immediate error.

## Input Completeness Checks (MVP)

Before execution, this MVP checks:
- empty selection
- blank selection
- comment-only selection
- basic bracket balance
- obvious unclosed quotes
- simple incomplete-expression heuristics

Note:
- This is not a full R parser.
- Heuristics may occasionally be conservative.

## Result Model

Current result model:

```ts
type PreviewResult =
  | { kind: "text"; summary: string; detail?: string }
  | { kind: "error"; summary: string; detail?: string };
```

Design intent:
- `summary` is used by inline preview.
- `detail` is used by preview panel.
- Easy to extend later to support table/plot/structured object previews.

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Compile:

```bash
npm run compile
```

3. Press `F5` in VS Code to launch Extension Development Host.

4. In the host window, open an `.R` file and select R code to test behavior.

## Packaging and Publishing

1. Install VS Code extension packaging tool:

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

2. Package extension:

```bash
vsce package
```

3. Publish to Marketplace (after setting publisher metadata and PAT):

```bash
vsce publish
```

Before publishing:
- update `publisher` in `package.json`
- set proper icon, repository, and changelog as needed
- test on Windows/macOS/Linux with real R environments

## Known Limitations (MVP)

- No persistent R session yet (each preview runs isolated process).
- No plot image preview yet.
- No table/grid renderer yet for data frames.
- No cache/reuse for repeated selections.
- Completeness check is heuristic, not a full parser.

## Future Extensions

Planned extension points are already prepared in architecture:
- plot preview output pipeline
- data.frame/tibble rich table rendering
- long-lived R session mode
- language server or hybrid architecture
- cross-file context execution strategy
- result cache and deduplication

## Troubleshooting

### Rscript not found

- The extension first tries configured rHiddenPreview.rscriptPath.
- On Windows, if value is default Rscript and PATH lookup fails, it will auto-scan common install locations under Program Files.
- If still not found, set full executable path manually in rHiddenPreview.rscriptPath.
- Example on Windows:
  - `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.4.1\bin\Rscript.exe`

### Frequent timeout

- Increase `rHiddenPreview.timeoutMs`.
- Reduce selected code scope.

### No output shown

- Check `showInlinePreview` and `showPanelPreview` settings.
- Ensure `autoPreview` is enabled.
- If workspace is untrusted and `requireWorkspaceTrust` is true, preview is blocked.
